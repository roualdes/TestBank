\begin{defproblem}{Avandia_setup}[fragile]
Rosiglitazone is the active ingredient in the controversial type~2 diabetes medicine Avandia and hasbeen linked to an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems such as stroke, heart failure, and death. A common alternative treatment is pioglitazone, the active ingredient in a diabetes medicine called Actos. Data collected as part of a nationwide retrospective observational study of 227,571 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older are summarized in the contingency table below.

\begin{defproblem}{Avandia_counts}[fragile]
How many patients on Pioglitazone had cardiovascular problems? How many patients on Rosiglitazone had problems? Can we conclude from these numbers that the rate of cardiovascular problems for those on a Pioglitazone treatment is higher.
\begin{onlysolution}[fragile]%
\begin{solution}
5,386 patients on pioglitazone had cardiovascular problems compared to 2,593 on Rosiglitazone. We cannot make this claim from these counts. Instead of comparing counts, we should compare percentages of people in each group who suffered cardiovascular problems.

Do the data suggest that diabetic patients who are taking rosiglitazone are more likely to have cardiovascular problems than those on pioglitazone? Justify your answer.
\begin{onlysolution}[fragile]%
\begin{solution}
Yes it does since the rate of incidence was (2,593 / 67,593 = 0.038) 3.8\% for patients on rosiglitazone, while it was only (5,386 / 159,978 = 0.034) 3.4\% for patients on pioglitazone.

\begin{defproblem}{Avandia_causation}[fragile]
True or False: The fact that the rate of incidence is higher for the rosiglitazone group proves that rosiglitazone causes serious cardiovascular problems.
\begin{onlysolution}[fragile]%
\begin{solution}
False. Association does not imply causation. We cannot infer a causal relationship based on an observational study. The difference between the two rates is subtle.

No. The results of this study are very unclear.
