\begin{itemize}
  \item You have XX minutes to complete this exam.
  \item The exam packet is \textbf{9} pages: \textbf{1} cover sheet, \textbf{9} questions, \textbf{1} page of R code, and \textbf{1} diagram. Make sure you have everything.
  \item The exam is out of \textbf{0} points.
  \item A single 8x11 page of formulas and definitions (one sided) is allowed along with a calculator. No worked out problems. This page will be turned in with your exam.
  \item Show all your work. Partial credit can be awarded.
  \item All phones must be put away during the entire exam. If your phone is out you will be asked to turn in your exam and leave immediately.
  \item Use the back pages as scratch paper, more can be made available. All scratch paper is to be submitted with your exam. If you want me to review notes on your scratch paper specifically, tell me so and make sure it's findable.
  \item Be sure to write your answers as full sentences.
  \item There is R code handed out along with the exam. Not all code is used in this exam, but all code necessary to perform the calculations on the exam is included. This will not completely substitute for a calculator.
      \item Indicate what the appropriate \R{R} code was to answer every question when you use it. This is not optional.
  \item The exam will not start until all materials are put away.
  \item Bathroom breaks are allowed, but you must leave all materials at your desk, and your exam with me.

%%%% DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS & BOXPLOT %%%%%%

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ages from a random sample of 20 dogs was stored in the R vector
  \R{dog\_age}, and shown on the first page of the Appendix for this
  exam. Use this information to answer the following questions.

%' Mark TRUE or FALSE on each of the following questions.
%' \begin{enumerate}
%'   \item Each column contains information on a single variable. \ifthenelse{\boolean{showanswers}}{False - each column contains the death rates for a certain combination of characteristics. Each column should contain only the information on what the variable is measuring. E.g. Gender should only have M/F options. The data contained in the rows is not a measure of age, nor gender, nor rural or urban location. It is a third variable - death rate.}{\qquad T / F}
%'   \item This data is structured in a way that it is easy to plot data on all males.
%'    \ifthenelse{\boolean{showanswers}}{False: Information on males is contained in two columns. Furthermore, we could not tell the number of males in the data set from this data, nor easily compare the overall death rate for males only.}{\qquad T / F}
