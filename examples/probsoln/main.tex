\begin{defproblem}{whyr}[fragile]
Other than ``To pass this class", what is one good reason you should learn how to program in \R{R}?
\begin{onlysolution}[fragile]%
\begin{solution}
A few examples of appropriate answers.
\begin{itemize}
\item It's free, so I can use it outside of school.
\item It is becoming more popular in my field as an statistical analytic tool.
\item It's open source, so I could contribute my own packages for others to use.
\item Because I plan on going to graduate school and doing research, and want to be able to conduct my own statistical analyses that are more complex than what Excel can handle.
\item Because I want to make better graphics than what can be made in Excel.

Are there any outliers in this data set? Use the fences to decide. State the fences and if there are any outliers, identify them.

\begin{solution}
The max data point 98 is below the upper fence of $Q_{3}+1.5*IQR = 114.75$, so there are no upper end outliers. The data point 45 is considered an outlier because it is below the lower fence of $Q_{1}-1.5*IQR = 48.75$.

\begin{solution}
Possible answers include but are not limited to
\begin{itemize}
\item They both have about the same size range of MPG (33-13=20, 43-23=20)
\item Most of the car data is between 30 and 40 MPG, most frequently around 32 or 33 MPG.
\item The truck has a lower overall mpg, the bulk of the data between 20 and 30MPG, most frequently between 23-25.
\item Both vehicles have potential low end outliers.

Which vehicle gets driven more? Justify your answer using two pieces of data.\begin{onlysolution}[fragile]%
\begin{solution}
The car is driven much more often than the truck. Here are the two most clear ways this could be determined.
\begin{itemize}
\item The frequency table generated by \R{table(fuelly\$model)} shows that the car has almost 3 times the total number of fuel-ups. This combined with the high average MPG on the car (as seen by \R{tapply(fuelly\$mpg, fuelly\$model, FUN=summary)}) indicate the car is driven more.
\item The summary of the odometer value indicates that since the start of data tracking, the car has been driven around 50k miles whereas the truck only has had 17k miles put on it.

They are not associated. If you were to draw a line down the middle of the data points for either of the two groups it is relatively horizontal.

\begin{onlysolution}[fragile]%
\begin{solution}
Most of the data for males is around 180cm, most frequently between 175 and 180cm. The bulk of the heights for females is around 165-170. I can make a reasonable guess that the average height for males is greater than the average height for females. The height of the histogram bars represent the frequency count of people measured in that range. For example, almost 30 males measured between 175 and 180 cm, and around 35 females measured around 165-170cm.\vspace{-2cm}

Graded on: Correct answer (1), justification (1), grammer (1). The variance would decrease because a 5 is closer to the mean than a 55.

There is likely a moderate relationship between the dominant writing and clapping hand. Almost all (97\%) of those who have a right hand dominant clap, also are right handed with writing. This combination is shaded light red, which corresponds to a moderately negative standardized residual score. This means the 3\% who are contrary is lower than expected if these variables were independent.
