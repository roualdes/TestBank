# check50 Example

This directory shows how TestBank can work with Harvard's
[check50](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/check50/) software. Consider
the homework assignment in `ex1.html`. A potential solution is given
in `ex1.py`. This solution could be checked with the following
command, called from within this directory, assuming `check50` is
already installed and TestBank is running in a separate terminal
window.

`check50 --dev checks/ex1`
