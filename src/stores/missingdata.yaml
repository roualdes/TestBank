  question: Can one have questions that output R/Knitr code to be compiled later?
  answer: |
    Sure.  Export this problem's answer into an Rnw file and dig this random number: $\Sexpr{rnorm(1, mean=101, sd=pi)}$.

  question: How do I write my own questions?
  answer: |
    Here's the things you'll need: 1) a reasonable text editor, if nothing else RStudio handles YAML files pretty well, if you've got nothing else: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/  2)  Learn some YAML: http://www.yaml.org/start.html 3) Expand upon this FAQ file as an example: https://github.com/roualdes/TestBank/blob/master/src/data/missingdata.yml
