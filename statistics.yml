  question: |
    Consider the new statistic $\kappa = \frac{\bar{x}}{median} - 1$, which can be used as a measure of skewness.  Assume all the data of interest are positive, e.g.\ $x_i > 0$ for all $i$.  Identify the skewness for the following values of $\kappa$ and explain your reasoning.
  parts:
    - $\kappa < 0$
    - $\kappa > 0$
    - $\kappa = 0$
  answer:
    - right skewed
    - left skewed
    - symmetric
