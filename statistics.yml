  question: |
    Pretend you are interested in determinging which turtles, sea turtles, box turtles, or snapping turtles, are better snow skiers.  Briefly outline a design for this study, making sure to include all principles of experimental design.
  answer: ["\textbf{Replication} we need to select multiple turtles from each category box, sea, and snapping.", "\textbf{Randomization} randomly select multiple turtles as specified above.", "\textbf{Control} we should ensure no individual turtle has an inherent advantage over the other turtles: equal practice, same skis, same slopes, same day,"] # check this syntax

  question: |
    Consider the new statistic $\kappa = \frac{\bar{x}}{median} - 1$, which can be used as a measure of skewness.  Assume all the data of interest are positive, e.g.\ $x_i > 0$ for all $i$.  Identify the skewness for the following values of $\kappa$ and explain your reasoning.
  parts:
    - $\kappa < 0$
    - $\kappa > 0$
    - $\kappa = 0$
  answer:
    - right skewed
    - left skewed
    - symmetric

  question: |
    Consider the differences between the reading and writing scores of a random sample of $200$ students who took the High School and Beyond Survey.  The mean and standard deviation of the differences are $\bar{x}_{read-write} = 0.545$ and $s_{read-write}=8.887$ points.
  parts:
    - Is a paired t-test appropriate for these data?  Explain why or why not.
    - Calculate a $95$\% confidence interval for the average difference between the reading and writing scores of all students.
    - Interpret this interval in context.
    - Does the confidence interval provide convincing evidence that there is a real difference in the average scores? Explain.
  answer:
    - Yes, data are paired on student.
    - c(0.545 - qnorm(0.975)*8.887/sqrt(200), 0.545 + qnorm(0.975)*8.887/sqrt(200))
    - We are $95$\% that the true population meand difference of reading minus writing scores for High School and Beyond students is between c(0.545 - qnorm(0.975)*8.887/sqrt(200), 0.545 + qnorm(0.975)*8.887/sqrt(200))
    - The confidence interval does not provide convincing evidence of a true difference as the confidence interval contains 0.

  question: |
    Suppose a new graduate is considering a job in two locations, Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA, and she wants to see whether the average income in one of these cities is higher than the other.  She would like to conduct a hypothesis test based on the following summary statistics:
    \begin{table}[!h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lccc}
    city & $n$ & $\bar{X}$ & $s$ \\
    \hline
    Cleveland & $82$ & \$$35749$ & \$$39421$ \\
    Sacramento & $84$ & \$$35500$ & \$$41512$ \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
  parts:
    - Set up and evaluate a hypothesis test at $\alpha = 0.05$.
    - Conclude and interpret in context the hypothesis test.
    - Would your test statistic be larger or smaller if the sample sizes increased?  Explain.
  answer:
    - |
      $H_0: \mu_C = \mu_S$ verse $H_1: \mu_C \ne \mu_S$ at $\alpha = 0.05$.
    - TODO
    - The test statistic would be larger if the sample size increased, since the standard error, in the denominator of the test statistic, would decrease.

  question: |
    Assume $X_1, \ldots, X_n \sim_{iid} Gamma(\alpha = 1, \beta)$, where $\beta$ is unkown.  The probability distribution function for $Gamma$ random variables is \[ f(x| \alpha, \beta) = \frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha-1} \exp{(-\beta x)}. \]
  parts:
    - List the steps to find the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for $\beta$.
    - Explain in words what the MLE is.
  answer:
    - Set up likelihood function, take natural log, take derivative with respect to unknown parameter, set derivative equal to zero, solve for unknown parameter.
    - The maximum likelihood estimator is the most likely value of the unknown parameter given the observed data.

  question: |
    Other than ``To pass this class", what is one good reason you should learn how to program in \R{R}?
  answer: |
    A few examples of appropriate answers.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item It's free, so I can use it outside of school.
    \item It is becoming more popular in my field as an statistical analytic tool.
    \item It's open source, so I could contribute my own packages for others to use.
    \item Because I plan on going to graduate school and doing research, and want to be able to conduct my own statistical analyses that are more complex than what Excel can handle.
    \item Because I want to make better graphics than what can be made in Excel.
    \end{itemize}

  question: |
    Report the median, lower and upper quartiles and the interquartile range. State the five number summary. Full sentence answers are not required here.
  answer: |
    The relevant R code needed to answer part a) and b) is \R{summary(dog\_age)} and \R{var(dog\_age)}
    \begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l p{1cm} l p{1cm} l}
    Mean = \Sexpr{mean.age} & & Variance = \Sexpr{var.age} & & SD = \Sexpr{sd.age} \\
    Range = \Sexpr{min(dog_age)} to \Sexpr{max(dog_age)} & & Mode = \Sexpr{Mode(dog_age)} & &

  question: |
    Are there any outliers in this data set? Use the fences to decide. State the fences and if there are any outliers, identify them.
  answer: |
    The max data point \Sexpr{max(dog_age)} is below the upper fence of $Q_{3}+1.5*IQR = \Sexpr{q3.age+1.5*IQR(dog_age)}$, so there are no upper end outliers. The data point 45 is considered an outlier because it is below the lower fence of $Q_{1}-1.5*IQR = \Sexpr{q1.age-1.5*IQR(dog_age)}$.
